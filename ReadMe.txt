In the two directories can be found two projects, one using Cucumber/Gherkin for behaviour driven development and the other using Selenium WebDriver. Both access the same fake e-commerce website and run end-to-end tests against it.

In order to trial these please clone the repository first and then go into each project's directory in the way you wish to run them
